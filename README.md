# Awesome Autoencoder for Representation Learning
*Last updated on August, 2020.*  
<br>

## Introduction
The dimension-reduction and generative nature of autoencoder-based models enables them for representation learning (e.g. using VAE as the feature extractor). This is particularly helpful when there is abundunt unlabeled data whereas labeled data is scarce (Sadati et al., 2019). In this curated list of literature review, we will focus on (1) recent theories to understand the learning ability and characteristics of autoencoders, (2) models and applications exploiting autoencoders for representation learning, and (3) adversarial attacks and defenses for autoencoders. We may also include some not so autoencoder relavant but representation learning relavant papers in this list.  

Papers listed are primarily organized by topic, then by conferences, and lastly by chronological order. A short summary will be accompanied below the paper if necessary. üßëüèª‚ÄçüöÄ denotes important papers from my own perspective.   

We organize the list as follows:  
- [Survey](#Survey)  
- [Theory](#Theory)  
- [Models](#Models) 
- [Applications](#Applications) (Here we are specifically interested in applications using encoder outputs for downstream task.)    
- [Attacks on Autoencoders](#Attacks)   
- [Defense by Autoencoders](#Defenses)  
- [Miscellaneous](#Miscellaneous)

> This papers shows that for a data manifold:  
> 1. There are generally two types of adversarial examples: **off-manifold** and **on-manifold**. 
> 2. **On-manifold** adversarial examples are generalization errors, and on-manifold adversarial training improves generalization.  
> 3. Regular robutsness and generalization are not contradicting.

> 1. Learn a **compressed** representation of the environment in an **unsupervised manner**;  
> 2. Use the learned representation to train a policy to solve downstream tasks.

Yingzhen Li   
*Rejected by ICLR Workshop, 2018*   
> This paper is more on the robustness of bayes classifiers compared to deterministic classifiers.  
> - Notably, it applies generative modeling (variational inference) to improve original bayes classifers.  
> - It implies that, generative models may fascilitate gradient masking which in turn become more robust to attacks. The stochastic nature of generative models may play an important role for gradient masking.
