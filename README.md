# Awesome Autoencoder for Representation Learning

## Introduction
This is a curated list of recent literature on autoencoders for representation learning. The unsupervised and generative nature of autoencoder-based models makes them popular tools for representation learning (e.g. using VAE as the feature extractor). In this list, we will focus on (1) recent theories to understand the learning ability and characteristics of autoencoders, (2) models and applications exploiting autoencoders for representation learning, and (3) adversarial attacks and defenses for autoencoders.

> - This paper is more on the robustness of bayes classifiers compared to deterministic classifiers. Notably, it applies generative modeling (variational inference) to improve original bayes classifers.  
> - It implies that, generative models may fascilitate gradient masking which in turn become more robust to attacks. The stochastic nature of generative models may play an important role for gradient masking.
