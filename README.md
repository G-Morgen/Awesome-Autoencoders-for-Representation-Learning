# Awesome Autoencoder for Representation Learning

## Introduction
The dimension-reduction and generative nature of autoencoder-based models enables them for representation learning (e.g. using VAE as the feature extractor). This is particularly helpful when there is abundunt unlabeled data whereas labeled data is scarce (Sadati et al., 2019). In this curated list of literature review, we will focus on (1) recent theories to understand the learning ability and characteristics of autoencoders, (2) models and applications exploiting autoencoders for representation learning, and (3) adversarial attacks and defenses for autoencoders. We may also include some not so autoencoder relavant but representation learning relavant papers in this list.

> This papers shows that for a data manifold:  
> 1. There are generally two types of adversarial examples: **off-manifold** and **on-manifold**. 
> 2. **On-manifold** adversarial examples are generalization errors, and on-manifold adversarial training improves generalization.  
> 3. Regular robutsness and generalization are not contradicting.

## Defenses  
**Are Generative Classifiers More Robust to Adversarial Attacks?** [[link](https://openreview.net/forum?id=BkVmRByPG)]   
Yingzhen Li   
*Rejected by ICLR Workshop, 2018*   
> - This paper is more on the robustness of bayes classifiers compared to deterministic classifiers. Notably, it applies generative modeling (variational inference) to improve original bayes classifers.  
> - It implies that, generative models may fascilitate gradient masking which in turn become more robust to attacks. The stochastic nature of generative models may play an important role for gradient masking.
